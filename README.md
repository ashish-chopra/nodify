What is it?
==============

Nodify.js is a custom module designed for Node.js to load browser based JavaScript or ECMAScript files without introducing any node specific modifications. It provides a coherent set of APIs to load single or batch of files together. To maintain security the files loaded are sandboxed so that they do not interfere with other loaded files.

The detailed API documentation is given in "Documentation" section below.

How to install?
=================

In order to install it as node module, download the zip of the desired branch from button at the extreme right in the bottom. Then rename the root folder to "nodify" and place it inside "node_modules" folder of your project. If you are installing it as global module, then place the downloaded code at your NODE_PATH location of your installation.
